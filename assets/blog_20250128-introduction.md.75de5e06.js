While Industry 4.0 was focused on increasing efficiency, connectivity, and machine intelligence through advanced technologies like AI, robotics, and cloud computing, Industry 5.0 shifts the focus towards a more human-centric, sustainable, and resilient industrial ecosystem. It envisions a future where humans and machines work together in collaborative, symbiotic environments, leveraging the strengths of both automation and human creativity. Unlike previous industrial revolutions that sought to replace human labor with machines, Industry 5.0 integrates human expertise with the precision and speed of intelligent systems, allowing for mass personalization, enhanced innovation, and ethical AI-driven decision-making. Sustainability is another core pillar of this revolution, ensuring that industrial growth aligns with environmental responsibility through circular economy principles, carbon neutrality, and energy-efficient processes. It also emphasizes resilience, ensuring that industries can adapt to supply chain disruptions, global crises, and changing market dynamics. By incorporating emerging technologies like cobots (collaborative robots), quantum computing, blockchain for supply chain transparency, and edge computing, Industry 5.0 enhances both productivity and social well-being. This shift is particularly crucial as industries aim to balance efficiency with employee satisfaction, ethical labor practices, and environmental consciousness. As governments, businesses, and researchers continue to explore the potential of Industry 5.0, it is clear that the future of industrial transformation lies not just in machines but in augmenting human capabilities, fostering responsible innovation, and creating a smarter, more compassionate world.",-1),l=[r,c,d];function u(m,p,g,y,f,b){return e(),i("div",null,l)}const h=n(s,[["render",u]]),v=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,__pageData:a,default:h},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}));export{v as _,a as __pageData,h as default};
